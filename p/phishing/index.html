			<h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
			<p>
				Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which a target is contacted via email, telephone or text message by someone disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity in order to obtain sensitive information from them. Sensitive information includes any personally identifying information, banking and credit card details, and passwords. This information is then used to access accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss. <br>

			<h3>Different types of Phishing Attacks</h3>
			<p class="listDescriptor">Phishing attacks can come in many different forms, such as:</p>
			<div class="bulletList">
				<ol>
					<li>Email phishing - Phishing emails are sent out en masse to a large number of recipients.</li>
					<li>Spear-phishing - A more targeted and sophisticated form of phishing, targeting the sensitive information of a specific individual or organisation.</li>
					<li>Vishing - Phishing that takes place over the phone. These calls usually have a sense of urgency and are made from spoofed IDs that appear to be coming from a trustworthy source.</li>
					<li>Smishing - Phishing that takes place using SMS messages. As with vishing, fraudsters often create a sense of urgency in order to get their targets to respond and carry out some action.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<h3>How can I identify phishing?</h3>
			<p class="listDescriptor">Some common features of phishing include:</p>
			<div class="bulletList">
				<ol>
					<li>A mismatched URL - If you hover your mouse over a link without clicking it, the full hyperlinked address will appear. If the URL does not match the address, the message is likely to be a phishing attempt.</li>
					<li>Request for personal information - A reputable company does not email customers requesting personal information such as credit card details or passwords.</li>
					<li>Poor spelling and grammar - It is unlikely for a message sent by a legitimate company to have poor spelling or grammar. If you can see any spelling mistakes or bad grammar in a message it may mean that the message did not come from a legitimate source.</li>
					<li>Threatening or urgent language - Phishers often use threatening and urgent language in order to make people click on links. Be careful of any notices that claim that your account had an “unauthorised login attempt” or that “your account has been suspended”. If you are unsure of the legitimacy of any of these messages, you can directly contact the company through their official website or telephone number.</li>
					<li>Unexpected message - Be skeptical if you are told you have won a competition you never entered or a random prize. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. </li>
				</ol>

			<h3>How can I protect myself from Phishing Attacks?</h3>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bulletList">
				<ol>
					<li>Never click on suspicious links - Phishing links may take you to a fake website that may prompt you to enter your personal information or that may directly infect your device with ransomware.</li>
					<li>Be careful of what you post online - Phishers can use all the publicly available information of a target online to launch a targeted and personalised phishing attack. Think carefully about what information you make public online and who has access to it. Use strong passwords and two-step verification.</li>
					<li>Verify the security of websites you visit - Look at the URL of a website before you visit it. If a URL begins with “https” instead of “http” that means that your data is secure as it passes from your browser to the server of the website.</li>
					<li>Use anti-virus software - This helps detect threats on your computer and can stop unauthorised users gaining access to your computer. Make sure any software you have is up to date so that your software doesn’t have old vulnerabilities.</li>
