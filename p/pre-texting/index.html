			<h3>What is Pre-Texting?</h3>
			<p>
				Pretexting is a form of social engineering where you use a made up backstory(The pretext) to attempt to manipulate someone into giving you important information. The most common way this is done is by a hacker acting like a co-worker or someone in a position of authority, they then utilize publicly known information to further gain the trust of their target and eventually get into a situation where they can get their target to reveal private or sensitive data. Pretexting is most commonly used as a setup for a bigger more targeted attack such as a spear phishing attack, where the information gained from pretexting will allow the following attack to look more realistic.

				A good example of pretexting is from the tv show Hannibal where Hannibal calls the office of the hospital administrator and acts like he is from the publisher of the administrator's book and wants the address of someone the administrator wants his book sent to. This works and he gets the phone number and address of his target. It is a good example because he gains the trust of the person on the phone by using public information that fits his story, he knew there was a different secretary and knew her name, knew the administrator had a book and then mentions that this was something that should have been sent already, he then highlights how much of a rush he is in which eventually causes the information to be given to him. He makes the situation seem plausible and engineers a situation where the person on the phone feels she has to be helpful and give out this information. <br><br>

				This is a dramatic example, but pretexting can be as simple as someone acting like a new employee and asking for someone to remind him about the recent password change. People want to be helpful and not hyper-suspicious so it can be surprising how even simple questions can get a hacker a lot of key information. <br><a href="https://www.vadesecure.com/wp-content/uploads/pretexting-3-1024x334.jpg">https://www.vadesecure.com/wp-content/uploads/pretexting-3-1024x334.jpg</a>

				An example of pretexting via email would be this image. This is an attempt to get someone's financial login information. You can see attempts have been made to make this seem familiar, mentioning the visit in Atlanta, working in Denver as well as the payroll being processed. The link looks correct on the outside, but will likely lead to a different website where the hacker will store the login information.

			<h3>How to protect yourself against pre-texting</h3>
			<p>
				The ways to avoid and prevent pretexting from working are: <br>
-Have a very careful password protection policy. <br>
-No matter how urgent, passwords should not be shared. <br>
-Be wary of unsolicited requests for important information, especially if they come across as urgent. <br>
-In general be very cautious with what information you share online, especially important information.
