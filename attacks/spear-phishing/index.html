				Spear-phishing is an electronic communications scam aimed towards a specific individual, organisation, or business. Often intended to steal account credentials and data for malicious reasons, cybercriminals may also attempt to install malware on a targeted user's computer.<br><br>
				Disguising themselves as a trustworthy associate or business the attackers can gain sensitive information, typically through social media, email or online messaging.
				People are very quick to place their personal information on the internet. With this information the attacker can build up a database of a person’s details such as their email address, friend list, posts, geographic location.<br><br>
				Over the years, spear-phishing has vastly improved in effectiveness and become more difficult to detect without prior knowledge on protecting yourself from an attack.<br><br>

				<h3>Tips to Avoid a Spear-Phishing Attack</h3><br>
			<p>
				Observe what personal information you post on the internet. Is there anything that you do not want a potential scammer to see?
				Use smart passwords: Do not just use one password or variations of passwords for every account that you own. Reusing passwords means that if an attacker has access to one of your passwords, they effectively have access to all of your online accounts. Use a password manager to store your passwords, e.g. KeePass or any online password manager. You may also check any password’s strength here: <a href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/">https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/</a>.<br><br>
				Update your software frequently: The majority of operating systems and applications include security updates that should help to patch up any software vulnerabilities. Where possible, enable automatic software updates.<br><br>
				Do not click links in emails: Check the destination of a link by hovering your mouse over it. If the URL does not match the link’s anchor text or the email’s stated destination, there is a good chance that it could be malicious.<br><br>
				Be smart when opening emails: If you get an email from a known associate asking for personal information including your credentials, carefully check to see if their email address is one that you have seen them use in the past.
